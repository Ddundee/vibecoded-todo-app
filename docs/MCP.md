# MCP server

The MCP server (`backend/mcp_server/server.py`) exposes your tasks to any
MCP-compatible AI client. It shares the same database and the same
`app/services/*` business logic as the REST API — it's not a separate
copy of your data, and creating/completing/rescheduling a task through
MCP is exactly the same operation as doing it through the web UI or the
REST API.

## Transport and auth

- **Streamable HTTP** (default, used by Docker): `http://<host>:8001/mcp`,
  authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`. This is what you
  want for a client running anywhere on your LAN or Tailscale network,
  talking to the server running in Docker on your Pi/home server.
- **stdio**: `python -m mcp_server.server --transport stdio`, for a client
  that spawns the process locally itself (e.g. Claude Desktop on the same
  machine you've checked the backend code out on, running outside
  Docker). No network auth needed since the client owns the process.

`/health` on the MCP port is unauthenticated (used by the Docker
healthcheck); every other path requires the bearer token.

## Connecting Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http personal-tasks http://<host>:8001/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your API_TOKEN>"
```

Replace `<host>` with `localhost`, your Pi's LAN IP, or its Tailscale
address/MagicDNS name, depending on where you're running Claude Code from.

## Connecting Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop's config supports remote (HTTP) MCP servers directly in
recent versions. In Settings → Connectors (or by editing
`claude_desktop_config.json` depending on your version), add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-tasks": {
      "url": "http://<host>:8001/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your installed version only supports locally-spawned (stdio) servers,
use the stdio entry point instead (requires the backend code + a Python
env with `requirements.txt` installed on the same machine):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-tasks": {
      "command": "/path/to/todo-app/backend/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server.server", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/todo-app/backend",
      "env": {
        "DB_ENGINE": "postgres",
        "POSTGRES_HOST": "<pi-ip-or-tailscale-ip>",
        "POSTGRES_PORT": "5432",
        "POSTGRES_USER": "todo_app",
        "POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "<your POSTGRES_PASSWORD>",
        "POSTGRES_DB": "todo_app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(Note: Postgres itself isn't published outside the Docker network in the
default `docker-compose.yml` — the stdio approach above only works if you
also expose port 5432, or if you're running the backend directly against
a local Postgres. For most setups, the HTTP transport above is simpler.)

## Connecting Cursor

Cursor supports remote MCP servers in its MCP settings
(`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or the in-app MCP settings panel):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-tasks": {
      "url": "http://<host>:8001/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Connecting ChatGPT / other MCP clients

Any client that supports remote MCP servers over Streamable HTTP with a
custom `Authorization` header can connect the same way: point it at
`http://<host>:8001/mcp` with `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`. If a
client only supports MCP servers with OAuth-style auth flows and no
static bearer header option, put a reverse proxy in front that injects
the header, or use `mcp-remote` (a small local proxy some clients use to
bridge stdio-only clients to a remote HTTP MCP server) configured with
the header.
